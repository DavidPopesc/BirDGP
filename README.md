Venue Website.
The website would have a homepage, an about/info, and it would allow you to reserve the venue and customize how you'd like to use it. The user might be able to choose how they'd like the venue used and set up, given example like a wedding, birthday party, quincinera, business event, party, and other different types of celebrations. They could choose different catering options, have additional services like venue setup/cleaning up.
