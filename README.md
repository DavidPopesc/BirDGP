In order to run this website locally you CANNOT just click on the files. You will need to locally run a server in order to view the website or else some javascript refuses to load (the navbar and footer.)

Run this command on your terminal that's set to the project's folder:
python3 -m http.server

and now you will be able to see the website at your localhost:8000.

Venue Website.
The website would have a homepage, an about/info, and it would allow you to reserve the venue and customize how you'd like to use it. The user might be able to choose how they'd like the venue used and set up, given example like a wedding, birthday party, quincinera, business event, party, and other different types of celebrations. They could choose different catering options, have additional services like venue setup/cleaning up.
